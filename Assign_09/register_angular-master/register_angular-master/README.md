User Registration form using Angular JS

Link: https://suhanip.github.io/register_angular/

This file contains the codes of single working sign-up page in Angular having the fields
  1.First Name
  2.Last Name
  3.Username
  4.DOB
  5.Country
  
  
This is a basic sign-up structure which isn't associated with database,so at whatever point the individual revives the page,the clients which have enlisted will get evaporated.
